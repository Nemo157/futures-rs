# Futures 0.1 Compatibility Layer

Rust's futures ecosystem is currently split in two: On the one hand we have the vibrant ecosystem built around [`futures@0.1`][] with its many libraries working on stable Rust and on the other hand there's the unstable [`std::future`][] ecosystem with support for the ergonomic and powerful `async`/`await` language feature. To bridge the gap between these two worlds we have introduced a compatibility layer as part of the [`futures@0.3`][] extension to `std::future`.  This blog post aims to give an overview over how to use it.

[`futures@0.1`]: https://docs.rs/futures
[`futures@0.3`]: https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/futures-api-docs/
[`std::future`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/future/

## `Cargo.toml`

The compatibility layer can be enabled by setting the `compat` feature in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
futures-preview = { version = "0.3.0-alpha.10", features = ["compat"] }
```

To use `futures@0.1` and `futures@0.3` together in a single project, we can make use of the [new cargo feature for renaming dependencies][renaming-dependencies]. Why? Because, even though the `futures@0.3` crate is called `futures-preview` on crates.io, it's lib name is also `futures`. By renaming `futures` version 0.1 to `futures01`, we can avoid a name collision:

[renaming-dependencies]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/specifying-dependencies.html#renaming-dependencies-in-cargotoml

```toml
[dependencies]
futures01 = { package = "futures", version = "0.1", optional = true }
```

**Note: Renaming the crate is only required if you specify it as a dependency.  If your project only depends on Tokio and thus only indirectly on `futures@0.1`, then no renaming is required.**

## Async functions on 0.1 executors

The compatibility layer makes it possible to run `std` futures on executors built for `futures@0.1`. This makes it for instance possible to run futures created via `async`/`await!` on Tokio's executor. Here's how this looks like:

```rust
#![feature(async_await, await_macro, futures_api)]
use futures::future::{FutureExt, TryFutureExt};

let future03 = async {
    println!("Running on the pool");
};

let future01 = future03
    .unit_error()
    .boxed()
    .compat();

tokio::run(future01);
```

Turning a `std` future into a 0.1 future requires three steps:

- First, the future needs to be a [`TryFuture`][], i.e. a future with `Output = Result<T, E>`. If your future isn't a `TryFuture` yet, you can quickly make it one using the [`unit_error`][] combinator which wraps the output in a `Result<T, ()>`.

- Next, the future needs to be [`Unpin`][]. If your future isn't `Unpin` yet, you can use the [`boxed`][] combinator which wraps the future in a `Pin<Box>`.

- The final step is to call the [`compat`][] combinator which wraps the `std` future into a 0.1 future that can run on any 0.1 executor.

[`TryFuture`]: https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/futures-api-docs/0.3.0-alpha.10/futures/future/trait.TryFuture.html
[`unit_error`]: https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/futures-api-docs/0.3.0-alpha.10/futures/future/trait.FutureExt.html#method.unit_error
[`Unpin`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/marker/trait.Unpin.html
[`boxed`]: https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/futures-api-docs/0.3.0-alpha.10/futures/future/trait.FutureExt.html#method.boxed
[`compat`]: https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/futures-api-docs/0.3.0-alpha.10/futures/future/trait.TryFutureExt.html#method.compat

## 0.1 futures in async functions

The conversion from a 0.1 future to a `std` future also works via a [`compat`][Future01CompatExt::compat] combinator method:

```rust
use futures::compat::Future01CompatExt;

let future03 = future01.compat();
```

It converts a 0.1 `Future<Item = T, Error = E>` into a `std` `Future<Output = Result<T, E>>`.

[Future01CompatExt::compat]: https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/futures-api-docs/0.3.0-alpha.10/futures/compat/trait.Future01CompatExt.html#method.compat

## Streams

Converting between 0.1 and 0.3 streams is possible via the [`TryStreamExt::compat`][] and [`Stream01CompatExt::compat`][] methods. Both combinators work analogously to their future equivalents.

[`TryStreamExt::compat`]: https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/futures-api-docs/0.3.0-alpha.10/futures/prelude/trait.TryStreamExt.html#method.compat
[`Stream01CompatExt::compat`]: https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/futures-api-docs/0.3.0-alpha.10/futures/compat/trait.Stream01CompatExt.html#method.compat

## Conclusion

The compatiblity layer offers conversions in both directions and thus enables gradual migrations and experiments with `std::future`. With that it manages to bridge the gap between the futures 0.1 and futures 0.3 ecosystems.

Finally a self contained example that shows how to fetch a website from a server:

```rust
#![feature(pin, async_await, await_macro)]
use futures::compat::{Future01CompatExt, Stream01CompatExt};
use futures::stream::{StreamExt};
use futures::future::{TryFutureExt, FutureExt};
use hyper::Client;
use pin_utils::pin_mut;
use std::io::{self, Write};

fn main() {
    let future03 = async {
        let url = "http://httpbin.org/ip".parse().unwrap();

        let client = Client::new();
        let res = await!(client.get(url).compat()).unwrap();
        println!("{}", res.status());

        let body = res.into_body().compat();
        pin_mut!(body);
        while let Some(Ok(chunk)) = await!(body.next()) {
            io::stdout()
                .write_all(&chunk)
                .expect("example expects stdout is open");
        }
    };

    tokio::run(future03.unit_error().boxed().compat())
}
```
